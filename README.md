##RULES
This game is a lot like blackjack in that you and the dealer are dealt 2 cards with one of the dealers hidden. The values vary from 1-13. Jack is 11, Queen is 12, and King is 13. The goal of each hand is to try and get your total as close to 11 or 20. There is no bust. Whoever has the total that is closest to one of these two numbers wins the hand. You only get to hit once so every hand is just one decision, usually whether you should hit and try to get closer to 20 or stay near 11 and see what two cards the dealer has. A push is counted as a win. The goal of the whole game is to beat the dealer at least 11 times on 20 tries. The quicker you get to 11 the better your score.
